Helps you handle multiple git repos more quickly and easily.

# Quick Example
This is still a work in progress, but here's a quick example of how it works!

`> alfred pull repo_1 repo_2 repo_3`

Or, to pull everything:

`> alfred pull all`

How about checking out a branch on multiple repos at once?

`> alfred checkout branch_name repo_1 repo_2`
